# Mental_Health_Analysis

## Project Overview
----

This project analyzes a comprehensive mental health dataset to uncover how lifestyle and demographic factors, including sleep duration, diet, work hours, screen time, social interaction, and stress levels, impact mental well-being across diverse populations and countries. Visualizing trends and patterns aims to generate actionable insights that can inform better mental health awareness, interventions, and policy-making.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
  - Age, Gender, Country
  - Mental Health Condition
  - Happiness Score
  - Work Hours per Week
  - Sleep Hours
  - Screen Time
  - Stress Level (Low, Moderate, High)
  - Diet Type (Balanced, Junk Food, Vegan, etc.)
  - Social Interaction Score

## Research Questions
- What is the ratio of mental health conditions between males and females?
- Understanding gender distribution across conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorder.
- How do work hours affect mental health conditions?
- Investigating whether longer or shorter weekly work hours are associated with increased reports of mental health issues.
How do lifestyle factors contribute to mental health?
Examining the impact of:
Sleep hours
Diet types
Stress levels
Social interaction
Screen time
Comparing happiness scores between different countries to uncover geographical patterns in mental well-being.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
This analysis of the mental health dataset revealed several meaningful patterns across lifestyle, demographic, and geographic dimensions:
- Happiness Score by Country
USA, Australia, and Canada recorded the highest happiness scores, while Germany and Brazil were on the lower end. These differences may be influenced by healthcare systems, societal support structures, and cultural perspectives on mental well-being.
- Diet and Mental Health
Respondents with a balanced or keto diet report higher happiness scores than those consuming predominantly junk food. This highlights the potential role of nutrition in supporting mental health.
- Sleep and Screen Time by Gender
Females show a slight advantage in sleep duration across the board. Screen time is fairly consistent across all genders but may inversely affect sleep and social interaction.
- Work Hours vs. Mental Health Conditions
Individuals with Anxiety and PTSD tend to work longer hours, while those experiencing Depression or Bipolar Disorder work fewer hours. This may reflect the impact of mental health on productivity and work-life balance.
- Lifestyle Correlations with Mental Health
Respondents with no reported mental condition generally report more social interaction and less screen time. Higher screen time and lower interaction levels are notably present in individuals with Anxiety and PTSD.
- Happiness Score by Diet Type
Balanced and keto diets are associated with the highest average happiness scores, suggesting a positive link between healthy eating habits and mental well-being.
 
 ## Recommendations
Based on the findings from this mental health analysis, the following actions are recommended:
-  Promote Balanced Lifestyle Habits
Encourage regular sleep patterns, healthy diets, and reduced screen time, especially for individuals with anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder. Community programs and health professionals can emphasize the role of these habits in mental well-being.
- Improve Access to Nutritional Education
Educate individuals on the benefits of balanced and low-carb diets for mental health. Partner with schools, workplaces, and wellness centers to provide mental-health-informed dietary guidance.
- Foster Social Connection
Design interventions that increase opportunities for social interaction, such as community events, peer support groups, or virtual wellness meetups. This is particularly important for individuals experiencing PTSD or anxiety, who may be more isolated.
- Rethink Workplace Mental Health Policies
Employers should consider flexible work arrangements and mental health days, especially for employees working long hours and showing signs of stress-related disorders. Implement employee wellness programs focused on mental health awareness and support.
- Country-Level Policy Development
Governments in countries with lower happiness scores (e.g., Germany, Brazil) may need to evaluate national mental health support, access to care, and social equity programs.
- Continuous Monitoring and Research
Encourage ongoing research into the relationships between lifestyle factors and mental health, using both quantitative dashboards and qualitative assessments. Regular data updates and dashboard enhancements will support real-time insight and better-informed decision-making.

## Tools Used
### Microsoft Excel
